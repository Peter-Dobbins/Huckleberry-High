            In a full stack web development role, you need to know how to code. You build a website
            that goes down onto someone’s browser and you’d also build the program that sits on the
            server that sends out that web page. There’s been kind of a tradition of splitting the two skills up so a company would have a
            front-end developer and a back-end developer. The cost of salaries in this field is quite high
            so from an employer's perspective, by combining the two into one role, you’re able to hire
            one developer instead of two.<span>"</span>
