        <div class="description-2"><p>Game developers work on teams to plan, design, and produce video games for computers,
            mobile devices, or game consoles. Their work involves creating visual content for the game
            and writing code to implement all the game’s features and functionality. This career
            requires a background in software development and mathematics and the ability to
            collaborate well with others to accomplish project goals. While many work full-time hours
            in game studios or at software companies, opportunities exist for game developers who
            prefer to work remotely or to self-publish their games online as independent developers.
            </p>
            <p>Game developers work in a variety of organizations. Specific duties and responsibilities
             may vary, but there are several core tasks associated with the job, including:</p>
            
                <p><u>Plan Game Projects</u></p>
                <p>After receiving the game’s specifications and feature requests, game developers plan its
                storyline, characters, environment, activities, scoring, and progression. They break the
                project down into smaller parts for the team to handle, create schedules with estimated
                timelines, set milestones, and create prototypes.</p>
                <p><u>Design Games</u></p>
                <p>Often coordinating with dedicated visual designers, game developers use computer
                applications to make 2D and 3D models of game assets, including scenery and characters.
                They also create graphics for game art and maps. This includes animating the characters
                and designing any virtual reality environments used.</p>
                <p><u>Write Code</u></p>
                <p>Using programming languages suitable for the game’s target platform, game developers
                write the code that implements the game’s logic and allows the player to interact with the
                game world and its characters. This often involves having responsibility for specific parts
                of the code or game features and working with other developers to make the final product.</p>
                <p><u>Test and Debug Games</u></p>
                <p>Testing and debugging occur during the development process and after the game ships to
                players. Game developers use their eye for detail and automated testing tools to check for
                broken features and functionality, inspect their code for errors as they write it, and handle
                requests to fix performance and reliability issues.</p>
                <p><u>Maintain Game Projects</u></p>
                <p>After production, game developers continue to handle new feature requests and make
                improvements to the game. This can include producing add-ons and game packs, making
                updates that introduce new levels and characters, and adding online gameplay
                functionality.</p>

            <p>Game Developer Skills and Qualifications
            Game developers need creativity, artistic ability, and technical skills to make interesting
            games that look and run well. Employers often require them to have a bachelor’s degree in
            a computer science field and up to five years of experience in game programming, game
            design, or software development. Strong candidates usually also possess these skills:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2D and 3D design – while game designers sometimes help create designs for them,
                    game developers still often work with 2D and 3D design tools to create game assets
                    and implement existing assets into the game
                    <li>Programming – depending on the game’s intended platform, game developers
                    write code in Java, C+, C++, Python, Swift, JavaScript, or other programming
                    languages
                    <li>Analytical thinking – game developers analyse the requirements their employers
                    give them to determine how to implement designs and write code for a functional
                    game
                    <li>Problem-solving skills – they need to think critically to solve problems when
                    debugging problematic game code, optimizing game performance, and turning their
                    design ideas into code
                    <li>Organization skills – collaborating with game designers and other developers to
                    complete projects successfully and on time requires an organized person
                </ul>

                   I was always a gamer but never really thought about creating one myself. I had played around
                   online with some free software and realised that I really enjoyed it. I applied to college then went
                   on to University where I got my degree. I have now been working in the industry for four years and
                   absolutely love my job.<span>"</span>
