            The Computing Science degree was not an educational path I originally looked for - it found me.
            After my first course in the Computing Science program, I never looked back.
            There are a variety of things that made my time at TRU worthwhile and helped me achieve my
            goals. There is a wide range of courses that involve not only technical understanding of course
            material, but applied learning as well.
            â€œGetting your hands dirty" in the software, hardware, and languages being learned assisted me to
            gain a stronger understanding of important material.<span class="quote">"</span>
