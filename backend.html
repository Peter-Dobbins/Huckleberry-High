               I was always interested in computing in school so decided to go to University to further my
   knowledge. I didn’t have the best interpersonal skills and felt uncomfortable speaking in front of
   people. I really enjoy the challenge of developing complex code. Working as a back-end developer
   I don’t need to speak with clients as often.
